<h1>The best animes according to me!</h1>

<h2>Here are the top 3 :- </h2><hr />
<h3>Your lie in April</h3>
<p>A romance anime on 14 year olds but it has the potential to make you cry!</p>
<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>It's not a love story but a story about love.</p>
<h3>Steins ; Gate</h3>
<p>An anime that can hit like truck-kun when needed!</p>
